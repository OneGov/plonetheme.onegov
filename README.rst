**Important** this package doesn't work with python 2.6, it requires at least python 2.7

**Important**:
- for Plone 4 use 3.x branch / releases
- for Plone 5 use 4.x branch / releases


Version 3.x introduces several major changes. Including a change of the default font-size to 16px.
If you're going to upgrade the package from Version 2.1.x to 3.x, please do it first on a
TEST environment. Changing the font-size may have a huge impact.


Usage
-----

::

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        plonetheme.onegov

- Install the generic import profile.

Features
--------
- Customize styles in control panel.
- Responsive design for tablets and smartphones

Layout customizations
---------------------

Theme is SCSS based and styles most things with variables which can easily be customized
in a control panel.

Just visit the customization view: http://localhost:8080/Plone/customstyles_form

Here are some examples how the Layout can be customized:

Additional SCSS
---------------

You can easily register custom SCSS files in your addon package using ZCML, if you need to customize
more than available through the web:

.. code:: xml

    <configure
        xmlns:theme="http://namespaces.zope.org/plonetheme.onegov">

        <include package="plonetheme.onegov" />
        <theme:add_scss path="resources/custom.scss" />

    </configure>

The SCSS files can also be restricted to a specific context interface or a specific request layer.
Be aware that the context interface applies to the context the styles are rendered on, which is either
the Plone site root or an `INavigationRoot` object.

.. code:: xml

    <configure
        xmlns:theme="http://namespaces.zope.org/plonetheme.onegov">

        <include package="plonetheme.onegov" />
        <theme:add_scss
            path="resources/custom.scss"
            for="my.package.interfaces.ISubsite"
            layer="my.package.interfaces.IMyPackageLayer" />

    </configure>

Flyout navigation
-----------------
This theme comes with a flyout navigation. If you click on an element in the global navigation you get the children as a flyout navigation and also a link to go 'direct to' the element you clicked on.
This behavior can be disabled in the plone.app.registry, using the setting ``plonetheme.onegov.flyout_navigation``.

Special path bar
----------------
For another fast way to navigate between content, this theme includes a special path bar, which shows the breadcrumb's children.
This behavior can be disabled in the plone.app.registry, using the setting ``plonetheme.onegov.flyout_breadcrumbs``.

Special filter form
-------------------

This theme provides an alternative search/filter mockup.
The full implementation needs to be done by yourself.
For an example check the `Solr search form of zg.ch <http://www.zg.ch/@@search>`_.

    :width: 900px

Development
-----------

In Plone 5 working on resources is a pain because they have to be recooked after every
change. Therefore there is a Grunt setup provided watching the resources and updating them.

To setup and run the watcher do:

::

    npm install
    grunt watch
